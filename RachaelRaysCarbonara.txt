Ingredients
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 pound pasta, such as spaghetti or rigatoni
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)
- 1/4 pound pancetta (Italian bacon), chopped
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 5-6 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 3 large egg yolks
- Freshly grated Romano cheese
- A handful of flat leaf parsley, finely chopped, for garnish, undefined

Preparation
Put a large saucepot of water on to boil. Add a liberal amount of salt and the pasta. Cook to al dente, about 8 minutes.


Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the EVOO (enough to coat bottom of the pan) and pancetta. Brown the pancetta for 2 minutes. Add the red pepper flakes and garlic and cook for 2-3 minutes more. Add the wine and stir up all the pan drippings.


In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks, then add 1 large ladleful (about 1/2 cup) of the starchy cooking water. This tempers the eggs and keeps them from scrambling when added to the pasta.


Drain the pasta well and add it directly to the skillet with pancetta and oil. Pour the egg mixture over the pasta. Toss rapidly to coat the pasta without cooking the egg. Remove the pan from the heat and add a big handful of cheese, lots of pepper and a little salt. Continue to toss and turn the pasta until it soaks up the egg mixture and thickens, 1-2 minutes. Garnish with parsley and extra grated Romano.
